\chapter{Part 2 -- Network Configuration and Analysis}
% Repeat for each experiment (1 to 6)
\section{Experiment 1 - Configure an IP Network}
\subsection{Network Architecture}
For this experiment, we connected TUX3 and TUX4 through the switch and 
configured their IP addresses as requested in the project description.
\subsection{Objectives}
State the learning objectives.
\subsection{Main Configuration Commands}
List the main commands/scripts used.
\subsection{Relevant Logs}
Show relevant logs and outputs.
\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.

\section{Experiment 2 - Implement two bridges in a switch}
\subsection{Network Architecture}
Describe the network setup for this experiment.
\subsection{Objectives}
State the learning objectives.
\subsection{Main Configuration Commands}
List the main commands/scripts used.
\subsection{Relevant Logs}
Show relevant logs and outputs.
\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.

\section{Experiment 3 - Configure a Router in Linux}
\subsection{Network Architecture}
Describe the network setup for this experiment.
\subsection{Objectives}
State the learning objectives.
\subsection{Main Configuration Commands}
List the main commands/scripts used.
\subsection{Relevant Logs}
Show relevant logs and outputs.
\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.

\section{Experiment 4 - Configure a Commercial Router and Implement NAT}
\subsection{Network Architecture}
For this experiment, the commercial router was connected to the lab network through ether1 
and to the Y1 bridge through ether2. The ip addresses and routes were configured as specified in the project description.
\subsection{Configuring a Static Route in a Commercial Router}
To configure a static route in the commercial router, we accessed its 
console and entered the necessary commands. We added a new static route with the destination network, subnet mask, and gateway as per the project requirements. After saving the configuration, we verified the route was correctly added by checking the routing table in the router's interface.
\subsection{ICMP Redirection}


\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.

\subsection{Relevant Logs}
Show relevant logs and outputs.
\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.

\section{Experiment 6 - TCP Connections}
\subsection{Network Architecture}
Describe the network setup for this experiment.
\subsection{Objectives}
State the learning objectives.
\subsection{Main Configuration Commands}
List the main commands/scripts used.
\subsection{Relevant Logs}
Show relevant logs and outputs.
\subsection{Analysis}
Discuss the results and learning points.
